This folder includes:  
- The "choice_probs.dat" file contains the probabilities to maintain a choice after a rewarded trial with common transition (second column), after a rewarded trial with a rare transition (third column), an unrewarded trial with common transition (fourth column), and after an unrewarded trial with a rare transition (fifth column).  
- The "choice_regress.dat" file contains data used in the logistic regressions. Please only account for the first column (subj number) and the last five columns (respectively trial number, block number, mn (previous trial rewarded or not), common (previous trial with common or rare transition), and stay (same first step choice or not)). The other columns are dummy variables from another script and do not relate to our participants.  
- "DMFinal.sav" is an SPSS file with clinical measures and MB/MF values computed as Sebold et al. (2014).  
- "dRT1.sav" contains the reaction times after a rewarded or non rewarded trials.  
- Individual data contains all the behavioral data of each participant.
